        <div class="col-6">
          <p>Palm oil is a vegetable oil that comes from the fruit of oil palm trees (Elaeis guineensis). It 
              is found in about 50% of all supermarket products, from food to cleaning products, to skin/hair
              care and cosmetics. Oil palms are native to Africa but due to the increasing demand for palm oil, 
              rainforests around the world, but particularliy in South East Asia are being cut down to make room for Palm oil plantations.
              <br><br>
              Today, Malaysia and Indonesia produce about 85% of the worlds palm oil, much of which is grown on the most biodiverse islands
              in the world, Sumatra and Borneo. These are the only islands where you can find animals such as the orangutangs, Pygmy Elephants, Sumatran Rhino's, Borneo Elephants,
              Proboscis Monkey, Borneo Bay Cat, and Sumatran tigers. They are just a couple of the animals going extinct due to habitat loss as a result of oil palm plantations.
