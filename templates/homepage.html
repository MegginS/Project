  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
   when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
   specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
   electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
   1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
   and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
   versions of Lorem Ipsum.

   as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
