## Unearth Palm

There are 193 endangered species that have palm oil production listed as one of their main threats. As the demand for palm oil rises, biodiverse forests are cleared to make way for palm oil plantations. Leaving animals such as the critically endanged orangutangs, pygmy elephants, Sumatran rhinoceroses, and Sumatran tigers with less and less habitat. Currently, there are about 47 millions acres of palm oil plantations which is over 5x what it was 40 years ago. Palm oil can be found in 50% of all packaged products we find in supermarkets.

The consequences of palm oil production have led to consumer boycotts. Some companies have bypassed the boycotts by not explicitly labeling ingredients as “palm-oil” leaving the ethical consumer unaware that the product contains palm oil. In the United States palm oil can be listed under 200+ different names. This site allows you to search food product to check if it is made with palm.
